## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap Library

### What I learned

In this project, I learned to include Bootstrap in the project, to use the Bootstrap library at a basic level and to customize the project by using Custom.css with Bootstrap.

### Continued development

I aim to develop my intermediate and advanced level of css and then learn Javascript->React-Vue libraries and frameworks. My goal is to learn back-end and become a fullstack developer after improving myself in the front-end part.
